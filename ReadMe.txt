C++ Chess Board Framework

Description / Comment
===========================================
This is an implementation of a two player, turn based, chess game that uses OOP concepts covered in Computing III.
The framework is work in progress but mostly fully functional, including
moving, opening double jumps, attacking diagonal, movement obstacle detection, and board bound checking.

Just the pawn piece is fully implemented. However, some strong OOP
concepts were implemented, so new piece movement can be implemented very easily by filling out
one abstract function, ValidateMove(Position newPos), in the derived classes for other pieces. 

Features:
  - Intro screen
  - 2 Player turn based Interface
  - Input uses standard chess algebriac notation
  - User can bring up help any time with "help" command
  - User Input Validation
  - Complete move validation for pawn chess piece along with attacking
